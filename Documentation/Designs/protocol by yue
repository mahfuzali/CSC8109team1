Explain of Coffry_Saidha fair exchange protocol:
Notations:
L: Unique label to link all message of a given protocol run
EOO: SigA(H(doc))
EOR: SigB(sigA(H(doc)))
Step1: Alice sends a request to TTP that she wants a fair exchange;
Step2: After TTP receives the request from Alice, it sends a unique label to Alice;
Step3: After Alice receives the label, she will send the document which she wants to give Bob and EOO(SigA(H(doc))) and label to TTP;
Step4: After TTP receives the message from Alice, it stores the document and sends the EOO(SigA(H(doc))) and the label to Bob;
Step5: Bob sends the EOR(SigB(sigA(H(doc)))) and label to TTP after he receives EOO;
Step6: After receiving EOR from Bob, TTP would send the document and label to B which it store before;
Step7: TTP sends EOR and label to Alice which means Bob will receive the document which she wants to give.
Step8: Alice and Bob send the label to TTP which means this fair exchange finished.
